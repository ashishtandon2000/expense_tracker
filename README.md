# expense_tracker

# Till now:
- Created listing of expenses and functional add button
- Added theming 

# Add :
- Adding chart
- Filter data
- Store expense in device storage, such that after closing app expense does not disappear - can use shared preference
- Method to export import excel.
- Edit, view expense.
- 

# Fix
- at some places we have set expense to int and at some we are taking double value.



# Learning
- Storing complex struct/models in hive is lengthy process, as they require adapters.
